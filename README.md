# World-Happines
<h2>
Once upon a time there was a data scientist who lived in a country called dystopia where it is the saddest city in the world. This scientist decided to travel around the world in search of happiness and during his trips from 2005 to 2020 I found that there are 6 factors that determine the happiness of countries, which are:<br>
1- GDP per capita<br>
2- Family and life expectancy<br>
3- Freedom<br>
4- Generosity<br>
5- Positive effect<br>
6- Negative effect<br>
He decided to use his analytical skills to compare countries and these factors,<br>
  and developed a model based on his conclusions. 
  He found that the higher the productivity, the greater the happiness.
  Hence, he decided to return to his town and present to the king what he found 
  and increase job opportunities in order to reduce corruption and increase the happiness rate in their country.
